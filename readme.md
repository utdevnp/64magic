# 64 Magic

**64 Magic** is a lightweight and efficient tool designed to convert normal strings into **Base64 encoding** while applying **compression** to minimize storage size or transmission overhead. This makes it ideal for handling large strings or sensitive text data, ensuring both compactness and reliability.

## Story Behind the Creation
The idea for 64 Magic arose from the need for a simple yet powerful tool to handle large strings efficiently. By combining Base64 encoding with compression, 64 Magic provides a straightforward solution for users who need to encode and decode text without the need for complex integrations or dependencies. It empowers developers with an easy-to-use utility that works across different environments.

## Features
- Convert any normal string into **Base64 encoding**.
- Apply **compression** for reduced data size.
- Decode and decompress Base64 strings back to their original form.
- Lightweight and easy to use.
